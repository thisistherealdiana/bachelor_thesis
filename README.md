# Kereselidze Diana's Bachelor Thesis

This repository contains my bachelor thesis «Constructive methods for linear inverse problems in transport theory». This bachelor thesis is devoted to the study of a linear inverse problem for a one-dimensional simple transport equation with absorption with a special choice of the right side of the differential equation. The original version was made in Russian, but the translation has been attached also.

Folders «Calculating function g» and «Calculating function u» contain the code written using MATLAB programming language. This code has been used to illustrate theoretical part of my research.

The thesis itself can be viewed in the pdf-files. Chapter «Results of numerical experiments» contains a lot of examples.
